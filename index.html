        </header>
        <p>
          Version control becomes powerful when you learn to branch and merge effectively. These features allow developers to work independently, test features, and integrate code smoothly.
        </p>
        <h3>🔸 What is a Branch?</h3>
        <p>A branch in Git is like a separate workspace where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase. It’s most commonly used for developing features, fixing bugs, or experimenting with ideas.
        </p>
        <h3>Uses:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Work on features independently
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid conflicts during development
          </li>
          <li>
            Test or debug without risking the main branch
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborate easily with teams
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>🔧 Common Branching Commands:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a new branch
            <code>
              git branch feature-branch
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
             Switch to that branch
            <code>
              git checkout feature-branch
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
             Or combine both:
            <code>
              git checkout -b feature-branch
            </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Merging Branches</h3>
        <p>Once your feature is complete, you can merge it back into the main branch.</p>
        <h5>Steps to merge a branch:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
             Switch to the main branch:
             <code>git checkout main</code>
          </li>
          <li>
             Merge your feature branch:
             <code>git merge feature-branch</code>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This brings all changes from feature-branch into main.</p>
        <h3>Handling Merge Conflicts</h3>
        <p>If the same part of a file was modified in both branches, Git will notify a merge conflict.</p>
        <h5>To resolve:</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open the conflicted file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Manually edit the marked conflict areas.
            </li>
            <li>
               Add the resolved file:
               <code>git add filename</code>
            </li>
            <li>
               Commit the merge:
               <code>git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between main and feature-branch"</code>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Delete the merged branch (cleanup)</h3>
        <code>git branch -d feature-branch</code>
        <h3>Example Workflow</h3>
        <code>
          git checkout -b feature-login       # Create & switch to new branch
# Make changes and commit
git checkout main                   # Switch back to main
git merge feature-login             # Merge changes into main
git branch -d feature-login         # Delete branch after successful merge
        </code>
        <h3>🚀 Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Always pull the latest changes before creating a branch:</h4>
            <code>git pull origin main</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Name your branches clearly:</h4>feature/signup-form, bugfix/login-issue
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Regularly push your branch to remote:</h4>
            <code>git push origin feature-name</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Test your code before merging
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Pull Requests (PRs) for team reviews on platforms like GitHub
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h1>Collaboration</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Collaboration is one of the key strengths of using Git and GitHub in software development. GitHub offers a variety of features that allow multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, regardless of their location. Here's an overview of how collaboration works effectively using GitHub:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Forking and Cloning Repositories
            <p>Fork: Developers can fork a repository to create a personal copy, allowing them to work on it without affecting the original repository. Forking enables multiple developers to propose changes independently.<p>
              <p>
                Clone: Once a repository is forked, you can clone it to your local machine to begin making changes. This allows offline work and synchronization once changes are made.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>Branching
            <p>Branching allows developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with the main project. Each feature or fix can be handled in a separate branch. This improves the organization and avoids conflicts.</p>
            <h5>Common Branches:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>main or master</li>
              <li>feature</li>
              <li>bugfix</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Pull Requests (PRs)
            <p>After making changes, you can create a Pull Request (PR) to propose those changes to the main repository. PRs allow the project maintainers to review, discuss, and eventually merge the changes into the main codebase.</p>
            <h5>A PR includes:</h5>
            <p>Title and Description: A summary of the changes being proposed.

Review: Allows others to review and suggest modifications.

Comments: Discussion space for any concerns or suggestions.
            </p>
            <p>PRs help ensure that all changes are thoroughly vetted before being merged into the main branch.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Collaboration Tools
            <p>GitHub Actions: Automated workflows for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), testing, and deployment.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Benefits of GitHub Collaboration:</h3>
        <p><strong>Version Control:</strong> Allows the team to track every change and revert to previous versions if needed.</p>
        <p><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Using branches and pull requests reduces the chances of conflicting changes being merged.</p>
        <p><strong>Team Communication:</strong> Through issues, comments, and PR reviews, team members can easily communicate and collaborate.</p>
        <p><strong>Open Source Contribution:</strong> For public repositories, anyone can contribute to the project, enabling innovation and community-driven development.</p>

          <h1>Best Practices</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Adopting best practices in Git and GitHub is crucial for maintaining a clean, efficient, and collaborative development process. Below are some industry-standard best practices that developers should follow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write Meaningful Commit Messages
            <p>Keep messages concise and descriptive.

Use the imperative mood (e.g., “Fix bug” instead of “Fixed bug”).

Start with a short summary (50 characters max), followed by a detailed explanation if needed.
            </p>
            <h5>Example:</h5>
            <code>git commit -m "Add form validation to contact page"</code>
          </li>
          <li>Use Branching Strategically
            <p>
Create separate branches for each feature or bug fix.</p>
            <p>Avoid working directly on the main or master branch.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Pull Before You Push
            <p>Always use git pull origin branch-name before pushing your changes to avoid conflicts</p>
            <p>
This ensures you're working with the most recent version of the codebase.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Keep Commits Small and Focused
            <p>Each commit should contain changes related to a single purpose or issue.
</p>
            <p>Smaller commits are easier to review, test, and roll back if needed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Use .gitignore Efficiently
            <p>Exclude unnecessary or sensitive files (like .env, node_modules, logs, etc.).</p>
            <p>
              Helps maintain a clean repository and avoid pushing local configurations.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>Leverage Pull Requests (PRs)
            <p>Never merge directly into the main branch.</p>
            <p>Use PRs to review and discuss changes.</p>
            <p>Add clear titles and descriptions for better collaboration and understanding.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Tag Releases
            <p>Use git tag to mark release versions (e.g., v1.0.0).</p>
            <p>
              Tags make it easy to roll back or reference stable versions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>Stay Consistent with Naming Conventions
            <p>Use lowercase letters, dashes, or slashes for branch names.</p>
            <h5>Example:</h5>
            <code>feature/user-authentication or bugfix/navbar-issue</code>
          </li>
          <li>Review Code Before Merging
            <p>
Perform code reviews before merging pull requests.</p>
            <p>
              Look for improvements in logic, security, readability, and performance.
            </p>
